We are working together 
doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted 
here is code written by us,
except for code coped 
from the instructors directories.

We both have read and understood
the UC Santa Cruz
Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.
https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html

We acknowledge that each partner 
in a programming pair is
responsible for the work performed  
by the other partner,
and all work has been reviewed by 
both partners working together. 
Both of us know the format 
of the PARTNER file.

Please grade Jay Pandit's submission 
And not Tanisha Khemka's.
